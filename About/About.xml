	<description>Ever wanted to have an army of insectoids at your disposal? With Improved Insectoids, not only is that possible, it's also very viable.

	FEATURES

As the mod's name implies, Improved Insectoids makes vanilla insects better by allowing them to sexually reproduce.

This means you will no longer have to risk your tamer's life every time you want an insect pet. You only need a male and a female insect (of the same species, of course), and you'll be able to mass-produce all the insects you want.

Additionally, megaspiders have a small chance to scare away other creatures near them. Affected creatures will try to flee from the map (unless they belong to the player's faction, in which case they will try to hide in a room).

	MOD SUPPORT

Improved Insectoids activates additional features if the following mods/DLCs are loaded:

	- Ideology
	A new meme called "Insect Primacy" becomes available. Followers believe that insectoids are the ultimate goal of evolution, and therefore place them in very high esteem - they will suffer large mood penalties for killing or slaughtering innocent insectoids or eating their meat. There are multiple other precepts that can be chosen, with issues relating to taming insects, eating insect jelly, and so on.

	- Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids
	All insects from VFE - Insectoids become tameable and gain a fear-inducing ability similar to the megaspiders'. Gigalocusts and megapedes get the ability to reproduce, and their wildness is reduced. Insectoid queens and royal megaspiders cannot reproduce due to having fixed genders, while larvae cannot reproduce due to never reaching adulthood.

Note that the aforementioned mods must also be on the latest version (1.3).

	FAQ

1. Do wild insects reproduce?
A. No. In vanilla, wild animals do not mate. Hostile wild insects will reproduce the usual way, i.e. by making more hives that spawn new insects every now and then. However, if you have the Wild Reproduction mod, they probably will be able to reproduce as well.

2. I can't add insectoids as venerated animals. Why?
A. Vanilla does not count insects as venerated animals. Theoretically, it is possible to patch this using Harmony, but that brings up another problem - each insect would count as a venerated animal by itself, thus needing 3 slots (in vanilla) or 8 (with VFE - Insectoids). Instead, it was much more convenient to make custom thoughts, issues, and precepts that apply to every single insect. They are not counted as venerated animals, but followers get similar mood buffs and debuffs depending on the situation.

3. Is this mod compatible with:
	- Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids?
	A. Yes. Some additional features are activated if it is loaded. See MOD SUPPORT.

	- Insects Have Chitin?
	A. Yes.

	- Wild Reproduction?
	A. Yes.

	- Better Infestations?
	A. Yes.

	- Insect Husbandry?
	A. No.

	- InsectUpgrades?
	A. No.

	- Breedable Insects?
	A. No. That mod is outdated, and Improved Insectoids does everything that it does anyway.

	- Tameable Insects for VFE - Insectoids?
	A. No. That mod is outdated, and Improved Insectoids does everything that it does anyway.

	- Any other mod that changes insects/reproduction/taming?
	A. Improved Insectoids uses xpath patching to work. As long as the other mod is also only adding nodes using patches, and not replacing nodes or overwriting defs entirely, it should be fine.

4. Is it safe to add to an ongoing save?
A. Yes, absolutely. Additionally, it is good practice to make a backup of the save file before adding it, just in case something unexpectedly goes wrong.

5. Is it safe to remove from ongoing saves?
A. If the save isn't using Ideology or the Insect Primacy meme, then it should be fine to remove this mod. If it is, then it's probably not safe to remove it. Note that any tamed insects from VFE - Insectoids will become hostile again. Regardless, it is good practice to make a backup of the save file before removing it, just in case something unexpectedly goes wrong.
